Purpose:
We want to remotely monitor a set of EMA (Ericsson product) processes in order to detect anomalies such as: resource leakage, excessive GC scans.
There is a multitude of tools that allows humans to introspect JVM stats but we want an tool that automatically monitors a set of processes and gathers stats for these.
The tool shall also use this gathered stats over time to detect anomalies and in such case report.

Requirements:
The application shall be able to attach (remotely/locally) to one (ore more) running EMA process(es) and extract JVM stats such as but not limited to: GC stats, min/max/current heap allocation.

The application shall be able to be executed from command line (GUI is optional/secondary)

The application shall log/append the collected data to file for later analysis.
Anomalies such as accumulating heap size shall be reported (exact method for reporting to be determined)

The application shall connect to the EMA process over the already existing JMX/RMI interface to extract JVM stats. 
The application must not require any changes to the EMA process, such as installing agents or configuring additional JVM settings.

Technologies:
Anything that can communicate with a Java process over JMX/RMI. 
Most likely a JVM based language such as Java or Scala. At least it shall be portable to "any" operating system.
The application is meant to be standalone, i.e. not executing on any application server.
